Portal Mod for Minetest-c55
---------------------------
Credit to Nemo08 and Hackeridze for making this mod.
Credit to me, whiskers75, for making it usable. :)

This mod adds portals to Minetest!
Simply make a 3x3 base out of obsidian and hit the middle with an obsidian knife.
If that fails, make the portal manually:
/giveme portal:baph_(number)
Replace number with 1-9 to get that piece of the base.
Line the whole baphosimb up, otherwise it will not work.
Arrange the pieces like so:

147
258
369

Then jump on piece 5 and type /activate [the portal's new name]
To teleport, type /tp [another portal's name]
And if you want to deactivate a portal, type /deactivate while on piece 5.

Enjoy!
